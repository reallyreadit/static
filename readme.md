# Readup Static Content
## Description
This repository tracks a subset of the static files hosted at `static.readup.com` that is useful for local app development. The `static.readup.com` server serves three main purposes:

1. **Hosting font and image files used by the various Readup clients.**

	 These files are included in this repository in the `content` directory. This will be the root directory of our `static.readup.com` development server.
2. **Hosting the web app and embed JavaScript and CSS bundles.**

    These files are generated by the `web` repository build system. We'll set up virtual directories at `/app/bundles` and `/embed` that point to the build output directories.
3. **Hosting extension and native client script files and indexes of those files in order to facilitate over-the-air updates.**

    Setup of these directories is currently a manual process not covered in this guide. Not required for development use except for testing of the script update functionality.
## Setup Guide
There is no build system in this repository. Follow the setup guide in the `dev-env` repository which covers setting up a web server which will reference the files in this repository.

## Deployment

This repository trackes the folders `app`, `common`, `email`, `extension` and `native-client`.

The `static.readup.com` bucket also hosts `email-content` (assets for specific marketing emails), `embed` (archives) and `media` (misc assets).

To sync the latest state of this repository to the ` s3://static.readup.com` bucket, without removing the content that is _not_ tracked here, run:

```
aws s3 sync --exclude "*.DS_Store" content s3://static.readup.com
```
