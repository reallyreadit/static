# Readup Static Content
## Description
This repository stores the static files hosted at `static.readup.com`. The `static.readup.com` server serves three main purposes:

1. **Hosting font and image files used by the various Readup clients.**

	 These files are included in this repository in the `content` directory. This will be the root directory of our `static.readup.com` development server.
2. **Hosting the web app and embed JavaScript and CSS bundles.**

    These files are generated by the `web` repository build system. We'll set up virtual directories at `/app/bundles` and `/embed` that point to the build output directories.
3. **Hosting extension and native client script files and indexes of those files in order to facilitate over-the-air updates.**

    Setup of these directories is currently a manual process not covered in this guide. Not required for development use except for testing of the script update functionality.
## Setup Guide
There is no build system in this repository. Follow the setup guide in the `dev-env` repository which covers setting up a web server which will reference the files in this repository.
